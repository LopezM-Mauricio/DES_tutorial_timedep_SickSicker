# abstract = {Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a flexible and computationally efficient approach for modeling diverse processes; however, DES remains underutilized in healthcare and medical decision-making due to a lack of reliable and reproducible implementations. We developed an open-source DES framework in R to simulate individual-level state-transition models (iSTMs) in continuous time accounting for treatment effects, time dependence on state residence, and age-dependent mortality.Our DES implementation employs a modular and easily adaptable structure, with each module corresponding to a unique transition between health states. To simulate the evolution of the process (i.e., individual state transitions), we adapted the next-reaction algorithm from the stochastic chemical reactions literature. Simulation-time dependence (age-dependent mortality) and state residence time dependence (transition from Sick to Sicker) are seamlessly incorporated into the DES framework via validated non-parametric and parametric sampling routines (e.g., inversion method) of event times. Treatment effects are integrated as scaling factors of the hazard functions (proportional hazards). We illustrate the frameworkâ€™s benefits by implementing the Sick-Sicker Model and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We also obtain epidemiological outcomes of interest from the DES output, such as disease prevalence, survival probabilities, and distributions of state-specific dwell times. Our DES framework offers a reliable and accessible alternative that enables the simulation of more realistic dynamics of state-transition processes at potentially lower implementation and computational costs than discrete time iSTMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDr. Goldhaber-Fiebert and Dr. Lopez-Mendez have no relevant funding to declare.

#* To program this tutorial we used:
#* R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)
#* Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
#* Running under: Mac OS 12.5
#* RStudio: Version 2022.07.1+554 
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Description ----

#* This code implements a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of a Sick-Sicker model
#* with recurrence.
#* Structure: 
#* Initial parameters stored in a list and  
#* Modules 1 and 2 are wrapped in the function `sim_next_event()`
#* which updates the `dt_next_event` and `dt_event_history`
#* A while loop executes sim_next_event until everyone in the simulation has died
#* Complexity included in the model: 
#* Time Dependence: the DES incorporate two types of type dependency
#* A. Simulation time-dependence (Age specific mortality)
#* B. State residency time-dependence (Transition S1 -> S2)
#*Treatment effect acting on transition rate S1->S2

# Initialize Parameters ----
#* We want to pass parameters seamlessly through our function sim_next_event(),

#* `dt_baseline` as an object of that list, now named `dt_next_event`.
